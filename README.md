# three-tiered-application-and-practice-manipulating-database-records

In this assignment, we'll manipulate records in a lowdb database. The database contains records for a publication and has form data with an id, title, and whether or not that content was published. Content can be submitted to the form and all data can be displayed, but nothing can be deleted. In this assignment, we'll implement functionality to delete all records from the database.
